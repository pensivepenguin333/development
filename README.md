### Goal and Value of the Application
With this web app, a user is able to filter a collection of 12 songs based on 
genre and artist, sort the displayed songs, and "like" the songs they want to 
add to their collection of favorites. The duration of the favorited songs is 
aggregated, and the songs themselves can be viewed by clicking the "View 
Favorites" button. This app essentially can serve as a way to create a playlist
based on the music the user enjoys; furthermore, by keeping track of the total
time of the liked songs, the user can create a "getting ready" or "workout" 
playlist, where the end of a song or playlist is indicative of the completion
of a task.

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes
